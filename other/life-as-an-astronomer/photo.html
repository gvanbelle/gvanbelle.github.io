<H1>Gerard's Photo Album</H1>

<HR></H3>

<P>There are three areas currently in my Photo Album:</P>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#research">Research</A> - More or less some highlights my
life as a wandering astronomer.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="#friends">Friends</A> - During my travels, I have always been
amazed with the interesting and wonderful people that show up in my life.
Here's a few pictures of these special friends (and at the moment I only
have a limited number of pictures scanned so don't feel left out if you're
not in here.)</LI>

<LI><A HREF="#sport">The Sporting Nardo</A> - In an effort to dispel the
myth about the reclusive academic stereotype, I have put this section in
covering some of the more interesting activities I've run across over the
past few years...</LI>
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="research"></A>
<HR width="100%">Research</H3>

<P><A HREF="iota5.jpg"><IMG SRC="g_wide.jpg" HEIGHT=80 WIDTH=184 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>That's
me at the <A HREF="http://faraday.uwyo.edu/physics.astronomy/iota/iota.htm">IOTA
site</A> south of Tucson, AZ, during the Fall 1994 system upgrades. I'm
looking a little scruffy; when this photograph was taken, I'd been on site
for over three weeks doing your typical observatory activities - milling
in the machine shop, heavy construction, and some plumbing. Behind me is
the 'dome' for the short arm telescope (our 15 m long NW/SE arm). My arm
is resting on one of the many piers we have for setting down the telescopes
at their stations. To my left and behind me is a corner of the control
building. </P>

<P><A HREF="fringe1.jpg"><IMG SRC="fringe1s.jpg" HEIGHT=95 WIDTH=120 ALIGN=LEFT></A><A HREF="fringe2.jpg"><IMG SRC="fringe2s.jpg" HEIGHT=95 WIDTH=122 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>FRINGES!
As pictured on the oscilliscope during a data collection sequence, a single
fringe packet is captured in these one second time exposures, clearly rising
above the noise. During a typical night, we collect approximately 2,000
fringe packets at <A HREF="http://faraday.uwyo.edu/physics.astronomy/iota/iota.htm">IOTA</A>.
These particular fringe packets were collected during our March 1996 run
to the site. Note the atmospheric phase glitch on the packet to the right,
while the scan on the left appears to be much cleaner.</P>

<P><A HREF="rocket.jpg"><IMG SRC="rockets.jpg" HEIGHT=168 WIDTH=73 ALIGN=LEFT></A>While
I was with <A HREF="http://www.jhu.edu/">The Johns Hopkins University</A>,
I worked with the Sounding Rocket Group. This is a picture of the payload
section of a rocket I worked on undergoing Flight Readiness Testing while
we were at <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.wff.nasa.gov/">Wallops
Flight Facility</A> during Fall of 1992. This particular test pictured
was the spin test. The flight designation of this particular flight, which
eventually flew out of White Sands Missile Range, NM, was 36.085.</P>

Friends</H3>

<P><A HREF="63757_15.jpg"><IMG SRC="6375715s.jpg" HEIGHT=135 WIDTH=201 ALIGN=LEFT></A>Also
in 1994, I attended the wedding of my friends Monica Blykowski and Dave
May, in Seattle. Pictured here are my friends John Ruble, Jeff Johnstone,
Jennifer Fredrickson, and Scott Bourn. <BR clear=both>
</P>

<P><A HREF="63757_19.jpg"><IMG SRC="6375719s.jpg" HEIGHT=103 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=LEFT></A>And
here's the blushing groom himself, along with me. <BR clear=both>
<BR clear=both>
<A HREF="ciardi.jpg"><IMG SRC="ciardis.jpg" HEIGHT=95 WIDTH=80 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>When
I think of my friend <A HREF="http://wapiti.uwyo.edu/people/ciardi/ciardi.html">David
Ciardi</A>, the phrase 'distinguished' comes to mind ... or something like
that! Apparently my head is slightly larger than his (strictly circumference
here), so my hats don't fit him too well, as evidenced here. <BR clear=both>
<BR clear=both>

<A HREF="bobvla.jpg"><IMG SRC="bobvlas.jpg" HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=118 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>My
officemate, <A HREF="http://plains.uwyo.edu/~bobbyt/">Bob Thompson</A>,
&amp; I traveled down to IOTA this past March (1996) for a data collection
run. Along the way we drove by the Very Large Array of the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory and did some astronomer-type sightseeing. In the
photo, note the radio telescope apertures off in the distance to Bob's
right (the picture's left). <BR clear=both>
</P>

<P><A HREF="house1.jpg"><IMG SRC="house1s.jpg" HEIGHT=87 WIDTH=115 ALIGN=LEFT></A>In
May of 1995, my good friend and former college roommate Dave Marshall came
to visit me in Laramie. Here he and <A HREF="http://wapiti.uwyo.edu/people/ciardi/ciardi.html">David
Ciardi</A> have me in a 'Dave Sandwich' (hold the mayo!) <BR clear=both>
<BR clear=both>
<A HREF="jhu1.jpg"><IMG SRC="jhu1s.jpg" HEIGHT=71 WIDTH=149 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>When
I was back at <A HREF="http://www.jhu.edu/">The Johns Hopkins University</A>,
we would have the occasional physicist party - yes, a scary concept. Here
I am with James Gerald and John Freeland at a Halloween party in 1992.
<BR clear=both>
</P>

<P><A HREF="hallow1.jpg"><IMG SRC="hallow1s.jpg" HEIGHT=71 WIDTH=149 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Being
at <A HREF="http://www.uwyo.edu">The University of Wyoming</A> has done
little to change that trend - here's Halloween of 1995 with fellow physicists
David Harker and John Medberry. <BR clear=both>

<H3>The Sporting Nardo</H3>

<P><A HREF="ved.jpg"><IMG SRC="veds.jpg" HEIGHT=142 WIDTH=120 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Here's
me and my buddy <A HREF="http://wapiti.uwyo.edu/people/ciardi/ciardi.html">David
Ciardi</A> clambering around on rocks at Vedawoo, near our home in Laramie,
WY. The view is absolutely breathtaking from up among the rocks, but don't
try doing much bouldering unless you've acclimatized to the altitude (8,000+
feet). David &amp; I are residents of Laramie (elevation: 7,500 feet),
so it's no problem. Comes in handy for us wandering astronomer types...!</P>

<P><A HREF="ski1.jpg"><IMG SRC="ski1s.jpg" HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=124 ALIGN=LEFT></A><A HREF="ski2.jpg"><IMG SRC="ski2s.jpg" HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=139 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Although
I'm a poor graduate student, I always enjoy to sneak in skiing whenever
I can justify the reckless disposal of large quantities of cash. On the
left picture, I'm out skiing with my buddy Dave Marshall at Snoqualmie
Pass, just above my hometown of Seattle, during Christmas of 1993. The
night skiing resulted in a bent pole... On the left picture, a day of hookey
this past January (1996) resulted in a quick trip down to Steamboat Springs
from my place in Laramie, WY. Although perhaps a rash use of time better
spent on research, I did take along a member of my Ph.D. committee, Ron
Canterna, and also fellow grad student Nor Pirzkal. Note that an absolutely
abysmal run on 'Rolex' at Steamboat resulted in a bent pole (brand new,
too - seeing a trend here?) <BR clear=both>
</P>

<P><A HREF="motor1.jpg"><IMG SRC="motor1s.jpg" HEIGHT=79 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=LEFT></A>Having
braved the initial investment, owning a motorcycle for me is the cheap
&amp; easy way to live out on the edge. My bike is a '85 Honda Interceptor
500 - nothing <I>too</I> fast, but fun nonetheless. It's a unique bike
(very few V4s on the road aside from the VFR series), rather pretty (it's
been pampered and the aftermarket lower fairing helps), and (knock on wood)
I have yet to get a ticket on it. <BR clear=both>
</P>

<P><A HREF="skydive.jpg"><IMG SRC="skydives.jpg" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=123 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>For
when owning a motorcycle just won't satisfy that primal death wish, try
skydiving. I wholeheartedly recommend the Advanced Freefall Class - somehow
hurtling towards the ground from 11,000 feet (here done above Chambersburg,
PA) tends to give a tad bit more of an adreniline fix than can be found
doing <I>anything</I> else. (As far as filling out that organ donor card
- a responsible must with respect to the motorcycle - don't bother with
skydiving...) <BR clear=both>
</P>

<P>Other ridiculous things I'm been found doing that I don't have photos
of, yet: scuba diving, windsurfing, racquetball and volleyball (hey, I
like to keep myself busy!)</P>
