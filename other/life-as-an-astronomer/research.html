<P>There are two specific areas to this page: a <A HREF="#statement">research
statement</A>, discussing my interests in astronomy; and <A HREF="../postscript/">postscript
versions</A> of my papers, documenting that research.</P>

Statement</FONT></B></P>

<P>Specifically qualifiing my research interests in astronomy, my primary
interest is in <B>experimental astrophysics</B>, specializing in <B>interferometry</B>.
I have a great deal of experience in observational systems, from the UV
to the visible to the IR, from ground-based to space-borne observatories.
In a nutshell, <I>I know how to make things work</I>, from design to construction
to operations to troubleshooting; machining, optics, electronics, programming,
and even plumbing are skills I've had to master along the road. Looking
at 'the road' itself can fill in the blanks: </P>

<P>When I originally started at <A HREF="http://www.whitman.edu">Whitman
College</A> back in 1986, I was interested in the 3-2 engineering program
that the college had with <A HREF="http://www.caltech.edu">Caltech</A>.
&nbsp;However, even though I was one of the few accepted to the program
(5 from roughly 150), I had been bitten by the astronomy bug and decided
to stay at Whitman, finishing out my degree in Physics-Astronomy, minoring
in math (in contrast to going onto to Caltech and doing double-E).</P>

<P>From there I went on to <A HREF="http://www.jhu.edu">The Johns Hopkins
University</A>. While concentrating on the usual curriculum of graduate
level physics, I never strayed far from my original roots in engneering
while pursuing my interest in astronomy. Among my more notable activities
at JHU were the installation and operation of a 20&quot; <A HREF="http://www.csn.net/~dfm42/dfm.html">DFM</A>
telescope on the roof of the new physics building, in addition to working
with the Sounding Rocket Group on a ultraviolet spectrophotometer payload.
The latter endeavor had me spending considerable time at <A HREF="http://www.wff.nasa.gov/">Wallops
Flight Facility</A> with flight qualification activities.</P>

<P>Finishing out a master's degree at JHU, I moved onto the <A HREF="http://www.uwyo.edu/">University
of Wyoming</A>, where I worked with <A HREF="http://faraday.uwyo.edu/physics.astronomy/facult/mdyck/">H.
Mel Dyck</A> and <A HREF="http://plains.uwyo.edu/~bobbyt/">Bob Thompson</A>
on the <A HREF="http://faraday.uwyo.edu/physics.astronomy/iota/iota.htm">Infrared
Optical Telescope Array (IOTA)&nbsp;interferometer</A>. Given the capabilities
of this instrument, we concentrated on <B>stellar astrophysics</B>, primarily
<B>late stages of stellar evolution</B> - giant stars, supergiants, carbon
stars, Mira variables. Angular diameters, and subsequently linear radii
and effective temperatures, of these stars were the main thrust of the
research; surface brightness distributions for these objects were also
an area of active research. I also spent considerable amount of time at
<A HREF="http://faraday.uwyo.edu/wiro/">Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO)</A>,
the department's 2.3 m telescope on nearby Mt. Jelm. Between IOTA and WIRO,
I spent about 1/4 of my <I>total</I> time at observatory sites (90 days
out of the year).</P>

<P>I am now working at the <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov">Jet Propulsion
Laboratory</A>, continuing to collaborate with Mel and Bob on the research
I started in Wyoming. Nowadays there's much less research time in my schedule;
however, it now includes time up at the <A HREF="http://huey.jpl.nasa.gov/palomar/">Palomar
Testbed Interferometer</A>. In addition to research, I spend the majority
of my time working on the design of the <A HREF="http://huey.jpl.nasa.gov/keck/">Keck
Interferometer</A>. </P>
