<a NAME="thrill"></a>The Thrill of Discovery</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">Looking over the content of this page, I've noticed that it's a tad caustic
- I was shooting for wry but maybe overshot in the direction of cynical.
As such, I felt it was important to add something about how, to me, being
an astronomer is truly thrilling. The lifestyle is indeed an adventure
in terms of your activities, locales and acquaintances - typically all
mixed together, too. Adrenaline is easily accessible, from doing gymnastics
on telescope support structures to sending up a rocket into the cold clutches
of outer space. However, the thrill of discovery is quite different than
any of these other rushes, and puts enough butterflies in my stomach to
fill the Astrodome. It's rare - thus far in my own life I can think of
only two striking examples of true discovery - and quite unlike any other
feeling. No one goes into astronomy for the money - but then again, this
sort of thing you just can't buy, either. Astronomy as a field is blessed
in that there are no shortage of worlds to explore and secrets to learn
from the cosmos.
</font>

<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Historical Aspect of Astronomy"></a><a href="lick.jpg"><img SRC="lick_sm.jpg" height=85 width=122 align=RIGHT></a>Historical
Aspect of Astronomy</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">Astronomy is, of course, the oldest science. It's the 
granddaddy of 'em
all - stars were being checked out long before the terms 'microeconomics'
and 'macroeconomics' were invented. Ok, I know, that's not a fair comparison
- economics is not a science. Developments in the field helped spur the
Renaissance, create the scientific method and pretty much make the world
what it is today; in a word, you have astronomy to thank for your microwave
ovens and steel-belted radial tires. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Having such a rich legacy in the field is not without its downside,
however. Many - it could be argued all - classification schemes for all
sorts of astronomical objects were dreamed up by people who didn't understand
what the hell they were talking about. Example - stars are classified by
their spectra, a dissection of the light into its component colors. The
original scheme started at A and went down from there - not bad, huh? Turns
out, though, that "O" was the most appropriate spectrum to go first - but,
as is commonplace in astronomy, the original classifications were kept.
So now students of the field are forced to learn politically incorrect
mnemonics to keep things straight ("OBAFGKM" doesn't really roll of the
tongue.) </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Social Status"></a><a href="sistine.jpg"><img SRC="sistine_sm.jpg" height=118 width=187 align=LEFT></a>Social
Status</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">People are always fascinated to learn that you are an astronomer. You are
the intrepid astronomer, going to the ends of the earth to explore the
depths of the heavens. Prying secrets from the very stars with extreme
prejudice is a walk in the park; untangling riddles lurking in the hearts
of galaxies is like taking candy from a baby. You grasp and bat about concepts
that would stop a herd of water buffaloes - or stock brokers, both being
functionally equivalent - in its tracks. Given our small numbers and well-cultivated
mythos, eyes will always widen when you reveal your superhuman nature.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">This fascination is especially evident in bars. Suddenly mere 
mortals
have in front of them what they perceive the font of galactic wisdom -
you, the professional astronomer. People have generally had a few, and
in the process of tying one on, they feel that they can plumb the secrets
of the universe - and you are their avenue for doing so. Questions from
these sort of people run the range from insightful to incoherent, typically
the latter, and generally involving questions about: </font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana">Extraterrestrial life</font></li>


<li>
<font face="Verdana">Cosmology &amp; God (always together)</font></li>


<li>
<font face="Verdana">Any random pretty picture that <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/top.html">Hubble</a>
has put out lately</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana">Most of these questions will be of only tangential interest to you, aside
from what you've glanced over in the latest 
<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/">Sky
&amp; Telescope</a>. Nevertheless, anything you say will be taken as the
gospel truth - I don't recommend that you abuse this special power you
possess, but with those particularly obnoxious and persistent bar flies
it can be fun.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><img SRC="flame.gif" height=60 width=30 align=LEFT>I believe that much
of this unique status can be traced back to ancient times. Back then we
weren't merely astronomers - we were the astronomer priests. Crops flourished
or withered &amp; died based upon what side of bed we got out of in the
morning; vestal virgins were lavished upon us; affairs of state were directed
based upon our interpretations of random events in the sky. Sure, tending
to the eternal flame could be a real nuisance, but my guess is that it
was no different then topping off dewars every 6 hours. Oh yeah, that heaven
&amp; hell thing - we called the shots on that too. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Ahh, here's to the good old days. </font>

<a NAME="AorA"></a><img SRC="molecule.gif" height=45 width=45 align=RIGHT><img SRC="blueball.gif" height=32 width=32 align=LEFT>Astronomy
or Astrophysics?</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">A common question - what's the difference? Well, none really, just semantics.
Astronomy without physics is like pork without beans. Trying to make it
in the field without kicking about Maxwell's equations or something of
the same nature is attempting to make it as a highly misplaced photographer
- it does happen, but about as often as you get an accountant who can't
add. If you want to split hairs, I'd say that an astrophysicist is the
person who can dazzle you with their theories about how the fabric of the
cosmos is woven together. The astronomer is the fellow who comes off the
mountain with actual data and proceeds to punch enough holes into those
conjectures to make a colander look watertight by comparison. </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Publish or Perish"></a><img SRC="apjlogo.jpg" BORDER=2 height=53 width=168 align=RIGHT>Publish
or Perish</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">An accurate statement, though the truth of it varies slightly with the
application of tenure. Put out less than two or three papers a year and,
well, you better be at a government facility. As far as actually getting
tenure, the process was discontinued due to overwhelming success. The last
person to receive the elusive golden ticket to permanent job security did
so in 1937; at last word, he was still on the job, refusing to retire or
even accept emeritus status.
</font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Tools of the Trade"></a>Tools of the Trade</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<b>Computers</b> - Bread and butter for anyone in science. These machines
act to help collect data and also analyze it after the fact. Also, they
are convienently littered about any scientific setting as easy targets
to direct any necessary swearing at. By design, curses directed at these
machines do indeed tend to make them perform better - this has been empirically
established in my own experience a number of times, usually in conjunction
with "Windows 95". Such a device can be both your best friend and worst
enemy. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="cryo.jpg"><img SRC="cryo_sm.jpg" height=91 width=72 align=LEFT></a><b>Cryogens</b>
- Highly sensitive detectors usually require operation at subzero temperatures,
and cryogens are abundant at observatories. Some of the popular flavors:
<br><i>Dry Ice</i> - Solid carbon dioxide. Formerly very popular with photomultiplier
tubes; it has fallen out of favor as of late.
<br><i>Liquid Nitrogen</i> - The favorite. Liter for liter, it's the same
price as milk, it's good &amp; cold (77 K), but not too much so - it's
still pretty easy to handle.
<br><i>Liquid Helium</i> - Somewhat exotic. Very cold stuff - 4 K - makes
it rather tricky (and dangerous!) to kick around; it's also somewhat expensive.
However, certain instruments need to get down past LN2 temperatures, so
liquid helium is not terribly uncommon.
<br><i>Solid Hydrogen</i> - VERY exotic. Used by the military in Star Wars
satellites (check out <a href="http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/MSX/MSX_Overview.html">the
MSX mission</a> for more information).
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Electronics &amp; Electrical Systems</b> - Note that this is quite
separate from 'Computers'. This subject comes in two flavors: digital and
analog. Digital is simply Boolean algebra wrapped up into devices that
you put together not quite unlike Legos - simple stuff. Analog, on the
other hand, is black magic. There is roughly a dozen people in the world
who truly understand analog; their leader is Paul Horowitz. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Optics</b> - High quality astronomical optics can be a real pain
in the ass to deal with. The stuff is difficult to align, impossible to
clean (a task best avoided), and never ever perfect, regardless of how
much money is spent on it. One is always left with the feeling that optical
elements are never quite pointing in the right direction, that they're
covered with just a little too much dust, and of course sporting better
than a quarter wave of ripple across the surface. None of these suspicions,
of course, can be ever resolved to your satisfaction.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Vacuum technology</b> - Loads of the stuff. Playing with cryogens
usually involves dewars; dewars are essentially giant Thermos bottles with
the detectors inside. What make a Thermos work is its evacuated sleeve
between its inside and outside worlds - no heat gets conducted. Dewars
sport the same design and as such astronomers get quite familiar with maintaining
such beasties. Note that vacuums mean pumps, pumps mean pipes, and pipes
mean that you've suddenly become the world's most highly educated plumber.
Unfortunately the pay is strikingly better if you stick to working on Maytags.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="mirshut.jpg"><img SRC="mirshut_sm.jpg" height=142 width=94 align=RIGHT></a><b>Fun
stuff</b> - As an observational astronomer, I've had to get proficient
with some downright unusual items. For example:
<br><i>Tucker Snow Cats</i> - Going up - and down! - Jelm mountain road
in the dead of winter, through six foot snow drifts is no task for even
the beefiest of 4x4's. So running this four-tracked behemoth is a skill
best developed at one's leisure, before it's needed in desperation.
<br><i>Cranes</i> - Even small telescopes tend to be ponderously heavy;
installation of these instruments is beyond the capabilities of even a
team of Navy Seals. Hence, heavy machinery often comes into play when dealing
with observatories.
<br><i>Exotic Materials</i> - Sapphires and rubies can be found in jewelry
stores, but they're also particularly useful crystalline structures when
it comes to dealing with light. Other not so 'precious' (but equally expensive!)
materials abound - my own experience is with fluorine derivatives, like
calcium fluoride and magnesium fluoride. </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="The Educational Process"></a>The Educational Process</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">Undergraduate Education - We all start out as undergraduates - snotnosed
little brats who are fascinated by pretty stars and oblivious to the amount
of math we're about to indulge ourselves in. Little needs to be said about
the undergraduate experience, except that remarkably few of us takes as
many physics courses as we should.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="jhuphys.jpg"><img SRC="jhuphys_sm.jpg" height=101 width=140 align=RIGHT></a>Graduate
Education - Welcome to hell. Graduate school is a process of being overworked
and underpaid, just to see who wants it enough. Excellence is replaced
by survival as the ultimate, elusive goal. There are two arenas of learning:
classroom knowledge, and actual knowledge. The former will tend to concentrate
on esoteric areas of physics that you will never ever use again after your
comprehensive examinations; any useful content that might be contained
in this phase of your education will more often than not be obviated by
inept teaching. The latter arena is rife with topics that you never even
knew existed but will learn to swear by - for example, IDL isn't listed
in any curricula I know of, but you'd be hard pressed to find a department
that hasn't shelled out the big bucks for the language. </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Travel"></a><a href="777.jpg"><img SRC="777_sm.jpg" height=96 width=148 align=LEFT></a>Travel</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">One of the interesting aspects of being a professional astronomer is that
it involves a great deal of travelling. So much so, actually, that at times
I find it to be quite a burden. Racking up frequent flier miles is great,
but it's small reward considering that you're locking yourself into giant
buses with wings for hours on end. And for goodness sake, the reward? More
of the same.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Typically travel falls into two categories - observing runs (data collection)
and conferences (data presentation). For those high on the food chain,
there is also travel to Washington, DC (getting money for collecting &amp;
presenting data). </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Observing Runs"></a><a href="wiro.jpg"><img SRC="wiro_sm.jpg" height=91 width=132 align=RIGHT></a>Observing
Runs</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<b>The Environment</b>
<br>You are a vassal of the weather. Its whim will dictate whether or not
you're slaving away from dusk till dawn, or puttering around surfing the
web. I have seen theses and dissertations take extra months and years merely
due to stray stratocumuli.
<br>Of course, observatories are typically mountaintop affairs in remote
locations (at least, those of the infrared and visible flavors), which
can make for spectacular surroundings. I have seen more fiery, vibrant
sunsets - and sunrises - than a shuttle astronaut.
<br>On these mountaintops, usually removed far from civilization, or at
least your own neck of it, the weather can be especially extreme. Subzero
temperatures further aggravated by 80-100 mph of windchill are no walk
in the park - but they help contribute to the intrepid astronomer mystique.
Also, one further aspect to note is that these remote locations also come
with their own particular collection of dangers. For example, down in southern
Arizona we I observe a considerable amount, there is a charming array of
death masquerading as local fauna - scorpions, bears, rattlesnakes, plague-ridden
vermin and poison spiders.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>The Equipment</b>
<br>You are at the mercy of the equipment. Equipment tends to malfunction
most vigorously when the weather is favorable - I've never had a dewar
go soft on me while it is raining out. It will do so swiftly, viciously
and without compunction as to how vital your research is to our understanding
of the universe - or at least, your projected dissertation completion date.
Accepting the foibles of the machinery is more important than ignoring
your observing assistant's bad personal hygiene. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><img SRC="coffee.jpg" height=80 width=103 align=LEFT><b>Stimulants</b>
<br>Let's face it, going from a 9 to 5 schedule to a 9 to 5 on the other
side of the clock (in a day or so) often requires an extra kick in the
pants - especially on that second night, about 3 AM. This requirement subsides
usually by about night four or five, but in the meantime you need all the
help you can get. Two popular choices:
<br><i>Caffeine</i> - The socially acceptable stimulant of choice. Available
in a variety of delivery systems - coffee, tea, hot chocolate, Mountain
Dew, or in its most unadulterated form - NoDoz. Of these, coffee is the
preferred method.
<br><i>Nicotine</i> - The socially unacceptable stimulant of choice. Few
American astronomers smoke, a large number of European astronomers do.
<br>Aside from these two legally available stimulants, I would guess that
there are other not-so-legal methods for staying awake at night, but typically
astronomers don't indulge in such things. Part of this comes from the typical
academian 'my body is my temple' attitude, but mostly it's due just to
astronomers being dirt poor. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Supplies</b>
<br>So you're going to be staying up all night for days on end - is there
anything special to bring along? Of course! A few vital supplies not to
forget:
<br><i>Chips Ahoy</i> - Not just any cookies, these particular ones hold
up well under the rigorous environment. A quick &amp; effective solution
to those late night munchies - pretzels work too, but only the large ones
(something to nibble, not gobble).
<br><i>Music</i> - Whistle while you work - and remember, the more obnoxious
the melodies, the greater your chance of staying awake while listening
to them. Particularly effective: White Zombie, Offspring, Shotgun Messiah.
<br><i>Extra Work</i> - On an observing run, you don't stand a snowball's
chance of actually <i>doing </i>outside work, but it's a good moral boost
- at least when you're packing.
<br><i>Email Addresses</i> - Social isolation is by no means desirable,
and email is a quick &amp; dirty way to stay in contact with the outside
world - e.g. "what day is it?" Keep in mind, however, that your correspondees
will soon tire of complaints about the weather or the equipment. It also
important to be aware that late night email composed before you've successfully
kicked your schedule over can be at best incoherent, and at worst incriminating.
</font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Conferences"></a>Conferences</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">So you've gotten your data, it's disproved everything you conjectured about
in your last paper - it's time to go crawl in a hole and hope nobody notices
you were dead wrong, right? Nope - you've gotten a golden justification
to write another paper (a good thing- see <a href="#Publish or Perish">Publish
or Perish</a> above), and even better, you can get government money to
go to some strange location to hang out with your colleagues who are doing
the exact same work as you (though usually avoiding the incorrect hypothesis
part).
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><img SRC="planet.gif" height=64 width=64 align=LEFT>Conferences are
a matter of networking - to meet people you need to convince your results
are true, and to go about convincing those you've already met. Typically
this job is easier if your data is good, so this is motivation to do your
astronomy right. Essentially, it's fraternity rush all over again - "Hello,
damn glad to meet you, come take a look at my poster paper - I think you'll
find it the best one on campus." However, since very few conference attendees
(they are, after all, astronomers) were in fraternities or even rushed,
the analogy is lost on them. </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Black"></a>Why are my Web Pages Black?</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a href="http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html"><img SRC="spinrib.gif" BORDER=0 height=70 width=40 align=RIGHT></a>I've
seen it mentioned on the web that "black backgrounds are obnoxious". Well,
there's two reasons my pages are black (or at least quite dark, as is the
case with this one). The first is that I switched my background to black
a few months back in support of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ribbon_Online_Free_Speech_Campaign">Blue
Ribbon Campaign</a>, supporting free speech online - that's also the reason
I used to fly the ribbon on my old home page.
Typically I object to the whole ribbon idea, whatever the cause - it strikes
me like a way that people try to indicate that they're more socially conscious
than everybody else, more or less a pissing contest if you ask me. But
it <i>is </i>an important cause - astronomy has had its share of censorship
already, just ask <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair">Galileo</a> - and along the way it helps me spruce up my
home page with a pretty graphic.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Secondly, I am an observational astronomer; if you look at 
my
bookmarks, you'll see that there's a lot of links set up for observational
work - satellite pictures, the 
<a href="http://simbad.harvard.edu/simbad/sim-fid">SIMBAD</a> database, etc. These pages see a
great deal of use when I'm observing - and since much of my work is carried
out under darkroom conditions, it's best to minimize the amount of flux
from the various computer screens. Hence the black background. </font>
<h4>
<font face="Verdana">
<a NAME="Prospects"></a>Prospects for Careers in the Field</font></h4>
<font face="Verdana">In a word, grim. Let's face it, astronomy doesn't <i>directly </i>benefit
the general public. Better toaster ovens have not resulted from characterization
of the initial mass function. As a result, jobs are in short supply; the
end of the Cold War has severely aggravated the already existing job shortage
for people who <i>could</i> be building bombs.
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">I should note that I do believe astronomy to be an absolutely necessary
endeavor of any culture worth its weight in salt. Astronomy has consistently
produced revolutions - and revelations - in how we view both the universe
and ourselves in relation to that universe. It is a hallmark of the curious,
exploratory nature of our species. Probably when we came down out of the
trees millions of years ago, our ancestors looked back up to whence they
came and saw the stars lurking between the branches. Without a doubt, the
first grant proposals were written soon thereafter. </font>
