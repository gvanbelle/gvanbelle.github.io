<h2>
<b><i>Famous Dutch Astronomers &amp; Physicists</i></b></h2>
<i>(Don't even begin to think this page is reasonably complete)&nbsp;
<hr width="100%"></i>The field of astronomy is one rich in tradition, being
perhaps the oldest science (at the very least tying with agriculture for
that distinction). Among the many historic figures in the field, there
are perhaps a disproportionate number of astronomers from the tiny county
of <a href="http://www.eeb.ele.tue.nl/map/netherlands.html">The Netherlands</a>.
Rumors of a 'Dutch Astronomy Mafia' are perhaps unfounded, but the fact
remains that a staggering amount has been contributed to the field by the
citizens of this small but charming country.
<p>This fact has also been noticed by Eric Weisstein in his <a href="http://www.treasure-troves.com/bios/topics/Dutch.html">Treasure
Trove of Scientific Biography</a>.
<br>
<hr width="100%">A few of the notable Dutch countrymen who made their mark
in astronomy &amp; physics:
<br><i>(obviously, more detailed bio's are in order, but here's what i
have so far:)</i>
<p>Nicolaas Bloembergen (1920- ) - Won the 1981 <a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/nobel.html">Nobel
Prize</a> in Physics for his pioneering work in nonlinear optics.
<p><i><a href="http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/BM2B.html#70">Bart
Jan Bok</a></i> (1906-1983) - Suggested in 1947 that small dark globules
of interstellar gas and dust (<i>Bok Globules</i>) were ungoing collapse
on their way to forming new stars.
<p><i>John Goodricke</i> (1764-1786)- Born in my own mother's hometown
of <a href="http://www.rug.nl/dsg/">Groningen</a>, The Netherlands. John
Goodricke accomplished poineering work in variable star observations. He
tragically died young, falling ill after a series of cold nights observing.
<p><i>Samuel Goudsmit</i> (1902-1978) - Demonstrated, with Uhlenbeck, that
Pauli's forth quantum number could be interpreted as spin.
<p><a href="http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/BM2T-Z.html#71"><i>Hendrick
Christoffel van de Hulst</i> </a>(1918- )- Predicted the existence of the
21 cm line during World War 2.
<p><i><a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/MoreInfo/casshuyg.html#huygens">Christaan
Huygens</a></i> (1629-95) - Among his achievements, Huygens disovered both
the rings of the planet <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm">Saturn</a>,
and it's major moon <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/titan.htm">Titan</a>.
The <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/Cassini/Spacecraft/#Probe">Huygens
probe</a> on board the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/Cassini/Spacecraft">Cassini
spacecraft</a> bound for <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm">Saturn</a>
is named after this astronomer.
<p><i><a href="http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/BM2H-L.html#10">Jacobus
Cornelius Kapteyn</a></i> (1851-1922) - Used density counts to establish
the shape of the galaxy.
<p><i>Gerard Peter Kuiper</i> (1905-1973) - Kuiper is well known for his
study of the <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/moon.htm">Moon</a>,
and discovering <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/miranda.htm">Miranda</a>,
<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/nereid.htm">Nereid</a>
&amp; an atmosphere on <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/titan.htm">Titan</a>.
The <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/kuiper.htm">Kuiper Belt</a>,
a disk of <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/comet.htm">comets</a>
inside the Oort cloud, is named after him , in addtion to the <a href="http://airsci-www.arc.nasa.gov/kao/KAO.html">KAO.</a>
<p><i>Anton van Leeuwenhoek</i> (1632-1723)- Perhaps miscredited with the
invention of the microscope, Leewenhoek was one of many 16th century Dutch
Spectacle makers that helped spur Galileo make use of the telescope to
revolutionize astronomy and Western thought in general (see an intriguing
related discussion at <a href="http://www.duke.edu/~tj/hist/hist_mic.html">The
History of the Light Microscope</a>).
<p><i>Hendrik Lorentz</i> (1853-1928) - Awarded the <a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/nobel.html">Nobel
Prize</a> in 1902 for Physics, along with Zeeman, for his theory of electromagetic
radiation, which in turn led to Einstein's theory of special relativity.
<p><i><a href="http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/BM2H-L.html#61">Willem
Jacob Luyten</a></i> (1899-1994) - Constrained the Hertzsprung - Russell
diagram and refined our knownledge of our own galaxy though observations
of massive numbers of stars.
<p><a href="http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/BM2O-P.html#37"><i>Jan
H. Oort</i> </a>(1900-1992) - Known for his proposition that <a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/comet.htm">comets</a>
come from a spherical shell surrounding the solar system, known as the
Oort cloud, and for the Oort constants (e.g. see <a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990MNRAS%2E244%2E%2E247L">Lewis
1990</a>).
<p><i>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</i> (1853-1926) - First to produce liquid
helium, in 1908; awarded the <a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/nobel.html">Nobel
Prize</a> in Physics in 1913 for this work.
<p><i>Anton Pannekoek</i> (1873-1960) - Established that Polaris is a Cepheid
variable.
<p><i><a href="http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/BM2S.html#85">Maarten
Schmidt</a> </i>(1929 - ) - Dutch-American astronomer who in 1963 identified
spectral lines in <a href="http://www.treasure-troves.com/astro/Quasar.html">quasars</a>
as highly red-shifted Balmer lines.
<p><i>Willem de Sitter</i> (1872-1934) - First to develop a cosmological
model of an expanding universe, now known as the Einstein-de Sitter Cosmological
Model.
<p><i>Willebrord Snell</i> (1591-1626)- Best know for his investigations
into the refractive properties of light (see <i>Snell's law</i> in any
basic physics textbook).
<p><i>George Uhlenbeck</i> (1900-1988) - Demonstrated, with Goudsmit, that
Pauli's forth quantum number could be interpreted as spin.
<p><i>Johannes Diderik van der Waals</i> (1837-1923) - Awarded the <a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/nobel.html">Nobel
Prize</a> in Physics in 1910 for his work on on the equation of state for
gases and liquids.
<p><i>Pieter Zeeman</i> (1865-1943) - First to observe magnetic splitting
of spectral lines, now know as the <i>Zeeman effect</i>. Awarded the <a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/nobel.html">Nobel
Prize</a> in Physics in 1902, along with Lorentz.
<p><i>Frits Zernike</i> (1888-1966) - Awarded the <a href="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/nobel.html">Nobel
Prize</a> in Physics in 1953 for his demonstration of the phase contrast
method, especially for his invention of the phase contrast microscope.
<p>
<hr width="100%">Part of this culture of excellence in astronomy is due
to the institutions found in The Netherlands. <a href="http://www.leidenuniv.nl/index_e.html">The
University of Leiden</a>, the oldest university in the country (established
in 1575), is home to <a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/">Sterrewacht
Leiden (Leiden Observatory)</a>. A page of links to other <a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/astroned.html">sites
of interest</a> may be found at the Leiden Observatory. The <a href="http://stkwww.fys.ruu.nl:8000/">Sterrenkundig
Instituut (Astronomical Institute)</a> at <a href="http://www.ruu.nl/">Utrecht
University</a> is also a center for astronomy in The Netherlands, in addition
to the <a href="http://www.astro.rug.nl/">Kapteyn Astronomical Institute</a>
at the <a href="http://www.rug.nl/rug/lijstuk.html">University of Groningen</a>,
and the <a href="http://www.astro.uva.nl/">"Anton Pannekoek" Institute</a>
at the University of Amsterdam.
